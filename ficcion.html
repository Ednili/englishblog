    <h3>Night of despair</h3>
    <p>One too quiet and peaceful night I was getting ready to sleep, at bedtime I lay quietly in bed, for some reason I didn't feel sleepy and I was awake for a few hours without being able to do something about it, being awake for so long gave me some thirsty so I got up to drink a glass of water and at that moment in a gloomy way I observed in the room a skeleton covered with living flesh staring at me, I obviously shocked I tried to alert my family about what I was observing, everyone They went to the room where I was to observe what I was terrified of but in a way nobody could see the same thing and I with a serious despair accompanied by shortness of breath because of the impact I tried to explain what I saw while stuttering, for some reason nobody I pay attention to myself and I on the verge of despair I tried to calm down and sat on the sofa while lowering my head a little, then raised my face again to explain carefully nto what I was observing but I was very surprised to see that there was nothing since the skeleton had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just calmed down and thought that I was simply hallucinating because I did not sleep, so I took a deep breath and got up to drink the glass of water and then go silently to my room, in my room I went back to lie down and tried to sleep without any success since I was still extremely shocked, from one moment to another I arrive rolling a ball apparently of a small child to my door I got up and took it and observed it but in a strange turn the ball began to disintegrate in my hand decreasing its size and inside it there was a small skull of a rare animal, the skull was dripping blood and I was scared too much so I threw it to the ground and at that moment I alerted my family again which began to look strange, I again without enough air to speak well I pointed out the point where the skull was but nobody observed anything and just as everyone was going back to their rooms I let out another mad cry saying to look at the skull or merging into one with the blood around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When everyone saw me strange and tried to calm me down, I ran out of my home at full speed towards the street, and outside I was shocked to the point of only being able to let out screams without being able to pronounce a word because outside there were hundreds of abominations, each one different from the another, in my desperation I tried to move away from the area in silence without attracting attention, once I was a few blocks from my home I stopped seeing abominations and I felt calm, I went to a park and sat on a bench that was there but when I looked back there were hundreds of abominations behind me, I tried to ignore them but out of nowhere they began to scratch me and cause me multiple wounds with their strange and horrifying limbs.

    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling pain and anguish I tried to flee but unfortunately 2 of them took me by force and began to take me to an unknown location for me, they were taking me through strange streets until we reached a city, it looked very nice but it was cloudy something grayish and there were no noises at that time but I observed a lot of humans and monsters coexisting in harmony I still did not understand anything and just observed that everyone was staring at me and in a strange way, the monsters took me to a small house where they put me the key and they stayed outside to watch.

    </p>
    <p>
      I was still just as confused that before I was at home for a while looking for ways to get out or ask for help, but to no avail since there were no more electronic devices outlets except for a television that was attached to the wall, and I was in despair I wanted to calm down again, but I couldn't so I just looked at the clock and saw that it was 04:00 AM I thought about sleeping, but I didn't feel sleepy so I decided to turn on the television, when I turned it on I observed the normal programming did not seem change nothing, I was watching TV for hours until suddenly the news started and I checked the time again, I realized that it was 06.00 AM and I assumed it would not be long before dawn, I felt a little hungry so I decided to open the fridge Just to see if there was any food, I was surprised to see a lot of food, then I made myself something on the stove there.
    </p>
    <p>
      After eating I noticed that 2 more hours had passed and it was not yet dawn, I just looked out into the street then I went to the door and opened it, when I opened it the monsters looked at me and gave me the way to the street, being outside I decided to walk a bit through the streets of that city I saw a small restaurant on the ground floor of a building and decided to go inside, and inside I sat by a window and once there a monster approached me and asked me with a serious time and he snores in my language -Do you want to order something from the menu? - I was obviously surprised but I already felt a bit calmer so I just read the menu and asked him for something. He walked away and I just looked out the window, after a few minutes a human guy arrived and sat in front of me then he asked me -Are you the new one? -I looked at him and said something nervous, -I guess so-, he smiled and said, -My name is Mike, it's nice to meet you -, I shook his hand and told him my name after a while the waiter arrived (showed) to take my food I gave him the as grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Me and Mike finished eating and we talked for a while later I asked the waiter for the bill and he laughed saying, -It's nothing sir, you can go- I was surprised and happy I got up and went out together with Mike then he continued to tell me that there is They live for free and they provided everything they needed to live, I was surprised and tried to look for exits many times but I never had the courage to go out, the sun did not come out in all those months, I still couldn't sleep and everything was going well at once strange way until one day I suggested to Mike to go out and go back to our homes, he and I planned it and carried out a laborious and complicated plan, and just before we left the monsters took us and I saw how they killed Mike and then me They tore me to pieces, then I got up on the couch in the house in that horrible city, I didn't understand what happened but I went to Mike's house but he didn't know who I was and said that his name wasn't Mike, then I met more people that he also wanted out and Mike's story repeated itself. Everyone forgot about me and the rest and they all had different names.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept trying to escape without success and the same thing always happened, everyone forgot everything and in the end I understood that there was no way out and that we were all condemned to live there living an eternal “NIGHT OF DESPERATION”.
